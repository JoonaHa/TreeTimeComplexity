Week 2 was spent with setting up javafx to work with gradle and coding the first algorithm (binary heap) as well as its tests.
Migrated most of the heaps functionality to a abstract class which the binary heap inherits.
Javadoc documentation started and some changes has been made based on last week's feedback.

P.S. Didn't realise that the deadline has changed from last week.
