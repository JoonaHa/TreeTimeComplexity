Week 4 was spent implementing Binomial heap which has suprisingly little material online and some sources contained contradictory statements.
 
Much of the time was spent debuging why every root in the heap only took three children max. 
First thing for week 5 is changing the way the BinomialTrees
store their children; from a ArrayList to pointers. I was hoping that i could had started the main functionality but fixing BinomialHeap take it toll.

Documentation was also started for the desing and testing documentation.
