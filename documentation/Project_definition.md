## Project Definition
### General
Projects aims to benchmark and illustrate differences between different kind of search trees and heaps. Also to present the advantages of different kind of structures for diffenret kind of data.

### Data Structures
The intention is to implement **Binomial heaps**, **Fibonaci heaps**, **B-trees** and some classics like basic **Binary heaps** and **Red-black trees**.
The time complexity will be ranging from constant time or O(log n) to O(n).

### Input and Output
Program will be a GUI-application and the user can choose what kind of trees/heaps will be used for the benchmark and the nature and the size of the used data.
The user can also select to use randomly generated data for the benchmark and the number of operation iterations. The appliation will show averages, worst and best case scenarios for different kinds of operations.
