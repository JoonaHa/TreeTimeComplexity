Week 3 wasn't as productive as I had hoped. Added few new methods to Heaps and chanced the behaviour of Heap's constructor.
Made some changed to tests based on last week's weedback (test data size 1000 nodes generated by Random.nextInt(INTEGER.MAX_VALUE) and spend some time getting more familiar with heaps.
