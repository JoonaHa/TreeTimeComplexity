Most of my time was spent on researching topics and coming up with a project idea that would be compelling but wouldn't eat up all of my time.
The vague definition of a suitable and propebly comprehensive topic made the choosing process to take more time as anticipated.

Week 1 included practical things like configuring version control and build tools as well creating the actual project. Documentation has been started with Project Definition and with this weekly report.
Planning for initial architectual and UI desing has started.
